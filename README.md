# Teach Yourself Computer Science

I am following a study map laid out on the following website.
(https://teachyourselfcs.com)
I have set up this GIT repository in order to document my studies.

I decided to follow this plan because it appears to provide a well rounded scope of knowledge that should stand me in good stead with my desires to eventually pursue a career in computing.

The plan consists of 9 topics, each with a corresponding books and online courses that I intend to complete. The courses are from prestigious academic institutions so I feel assured that my endeavors shall not be wasted. The content shall be accurate and should develop skills that an employer will be seeking.

## The Topics

### 1. Programming

### 2. Computer Architecture

### 3. Algorithms and Data Structures

### 4. Math for CS

### 5. Operating Systems

### 6. Computer Networking
