For those seeking a gentle introduction to this topic the guide suggested reading the first 6 chapters of The Elements of Computing Systems (also known as Nand2Tetris) and completing the associated challenges.
Each chapter involves building a small piece of the overall system, from writing elementary logic gates in HDL, through a CPU and assembler, all the way to an application the size of a Tetris game.
