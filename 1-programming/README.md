# Programming

For this topic I decided to read the book Composing Programs by John DeNero and complete the corresponding course (led by John DeNero) CS61A provided by the University of California, Berkeley.

The other choice was the famous Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs book. However this book and corresponding course is centered on the Scheme programming language and my MacBook (with an M2 chip) is currently compatible with this language.

John DeNero's Composing Programs is in the tradition of SICP but uses Python. A programming language that I was already familiar with as well as being compatible with my machine.
